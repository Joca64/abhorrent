A DOOM II wad - Work in progress

A vanilla DOOM II wad, with no custom textures, enemies or items. Aiming for 9-10 maps.<br>
Tested mostly with the OpenGL version of prboom+, but it should\* work with any other source port, as well as the original.<br>
######\*assuming I didn't break any of the original limits
<br>

Current maps (with a random screenshot):<br>
